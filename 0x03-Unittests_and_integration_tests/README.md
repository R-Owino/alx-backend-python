## Unittests and Integration Tests
- Unittests are used by developers on units of source code.
    * Individual parts of a program are isolated and tested to show that they're correct and meet requirements and functionality.
    * It tests that a particular function returns expected results for different sets of inputs.
    * It tests to see that a function works as expected if everything outside the function works as expected.

- Integration tests, on the other hand, tests interaction between every part of the code; it tests the code path end-to-end.

### Learning Goals
* The difference between unit and integration tests.
* Common testing patterns such as mocking, parametrizations and fixtures
